/* game-sw.js — reference service worker for Paul's Arcade games.
 *
 * Copy this file into your game repo as sw.js (at the repo root, so it lives
 * inside your scope) and register it from your game's index.html:
 *
 *   if ('serviceWorker' in navigator &&
 *       !/^(127\.|localhost$|0\.0\.0\.0$|::1$)/.test(location.hostname)) {
 *     navigator.serviceWorker.register('sw.js', { scope: '/shuiguo/' });
 *   }
 *
 * (The loopback guard keeps local-dev edits from being masked by stale
 * cache, matching the launcher's own behavior.)
 *
 * THE TWO RULES — every game and the launcher share ONE origin:
 *
 *   1. Never serve or cache anything outside /shuiguo/. The fetch
 *      handler below early-returns for out-of-scope URLs, so /arcade-sdk.js
 *      and launcher assets always come from the network (or the launcher's
 *      own SW). The Arcade SDK reports a console error — and a visible toast
 *      in ?dev=1 mode — if it finds launcher files in a game's cache.
 *
 *   2. Never clean up origin-wide. `caches.keys()` and
 *      `getRegistrations()` see EVERY game's caches and workers plus the
 *      launcher's. Delete only cache names you created (the version-keyed
 *      prefix filter below); never call registration.unregister() on
 *      registrations that aren't yours.
 *
 *   3. Never activate unannounced. install() must NOT skipWaiting(); the new
 *      worker waits, and the launcher's update control offers the player a
 *      reload and then sends the message handled below. Swapping the cache
 *      under a running game means code from one build fetching assets from
 *      another. This is also the recovery path that makes cache-first safe.
